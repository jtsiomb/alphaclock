About
-----
Alphaclock is a transparent clock for the desktop. It renders the time using
pointless eye-candy, seamlessly integrated onto your desktop, thanks to the
alpha blending capabilities of X compositors.

Alphaclock requires a compositing manager to be running, for the effect to work
properly.
